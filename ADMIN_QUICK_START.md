## ⚡ Tips & Tricks

### ✅ DO:
- Use clear, simple names: "S, M, L, XL"
- Separate with commas: "Option1, Option2, Option3"
- Use natural descriptions: "Petit (40cm), Moyen (60cm)"
- Include spaces after commas (system trims them)
- Use realistic variant names customers recognize

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use special characters like: `|` `\` `/` `[]` `{}`
- Leave extra spaces: `S,  M,  L` (system handles this)
- Use very long lists (over 20+ options)
- Mix units inconsistently: "Small, 40cm, X-Large"
